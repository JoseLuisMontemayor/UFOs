# UFOs

### Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to build a UFO webpage to display stored interesting data about the topic, allowing users to search for events that happened. To create the webpage we utilized HTML and Bootstrap to create a visual for the user, with the simplicity for searching a specific date, city, state and several more options. All of these with a user input. 

### Results

As you enter the webpage you will encounter a display like this:

You will be able to filter data below the label "Filter Search";

- As mentioned, the website can display the information with filters as the Date, City, State, Country, Shape.
- To nagivate through this filters, you need to click on the textbox and enter the information that you desire to see. 
- If an invalid option is entered, or the data does not exist, the ouput with the events will appear blank and you would need to try again. 
- Another option is to refresh the page and enter again filter again conditions you wish to see. 

For example, if a user would want to search for the data with the date 1/13/2010, the display would be the next:

* Insertar foto con la data filtrada*

### Summary 

One drawback in the dataset is that only the range of country of the information is within the US, limiting other users from around the world from using the platform, since that may be interested in the first place in searching in another country. A recomendation could be to search for more data online and add it to the data file in the js folder, which would extend the amount of information to be displayed. Another recommendation would be to have a better visual of the webpage in general, making it more aesthetic for it to be more attractive for the users.
