# UFOs

### Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to build a UFO webpage to display stored interesting data about the topic, allowing users to search for events that happened. To create the webpage we utilized HTML and Bootstrap to create a visual for the user, with the simplicity for searching a specific date, city, state and several more options. All of these with a user input. 

### Results

As you enter the webpage you will encounter a display like this: 

*Insertar foto de la pagina completa*

You will be able to filter data below the label "Filter Search"

* Insertar foto con un recuadro en los filtros*

- As mentioned, the website can display the information with filters as the Date, City, State, Country, Shape.
- To nagivate through this filters, you need to click on the textbox and enter the information that you desire to see. 
- If an invalid option is entered, or the data does not exist, the ouput with the events will appear blank and you would need to try again. 
- Another option is to refresh the page and enter again filter again conditions you wish to see. 

For example, if a user would want to search for the data with the date 1/13/2010, the display would be the next:

* Insertar foto con la data filtrada*
